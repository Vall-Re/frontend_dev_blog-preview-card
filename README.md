- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this project I practiced:

- Creating responsive layouts using mobile-first approach

- Working with hover states

- Using border-radius and shadows correctly

- Structuring clean semantic HTML

```css
.title:hover {
  color: #F4D04E;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I want to:

- Improve my responsive design skills

- Write cleaner and more scalable CSS

- Practice using Grid more confidently
